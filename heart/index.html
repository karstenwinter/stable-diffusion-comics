<p class="text top-left">True! nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line03_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231423_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">The disease had sharpened my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line04_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231424_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Above all was the sense of hearing acute.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line05_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231425_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line06_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231426_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">How then am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily, how calmly I can tell you the whole story.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line07_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231427_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain, but, once conceived, it haunted me day and night.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line08_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231428_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line09_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231429_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line10_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231430_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture—a pale blue eye with a film over it.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line11_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231431_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line12_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231432_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line13_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231433_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">You should have seen how wisely I proceeded; with what caution, with what foresight, with what dissimulation, I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line14_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231434_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And every night about midnight I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! And then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head I put in a dark lantern all closed, closed so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line15_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231435_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly, very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line16_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231436_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line17_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231437_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this? And then when my head was well in the room I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked), I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line18_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231438_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And this I did for seven long nights, every night just at midnight, but I found the eye always closed, and so it was impossible to do the work, for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line19_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231439_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line20_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231440_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line21_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231441_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line22_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231442_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line23_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231443_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers, of my sagacity.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line24_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231444_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line25_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231445_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">To think that there I was opening the door little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line26_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231446_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I fairly chuckled at the idea, and perhaps he heard me, for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line27_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231447_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Now you may think that I drew back—but no.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line28_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231448_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line29_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231449_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out, "Who's there?"</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line30_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231450_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line31_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231451_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">He was still sitting up in the bed, listening; just as I have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line32_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231452_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line33_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231453_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no! it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line34_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231454_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line35_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231455_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line36_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231456_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line37_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231457_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line38_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231458_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">He had been saying to himself, "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney, it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all in vain.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line39_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231459_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">All in vain, because Death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line40_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231460_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel, although he neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence of my head within the room.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line41_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231461_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">When I had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the lantern.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line42_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231462_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily—until at length a single dim ray like the thread of the spider shot out from the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line43_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231463_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">It was open, wide, wide open, and I grew furious as I gazed upon it.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line44_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231464_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones, but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person, for I had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line45_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231465_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses? now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line46_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231466_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line47_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231467_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. But even yet I refrained and kept still.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line48_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231468_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line49_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231469_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder, every instant.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line50_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231470_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line51_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231471_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line52_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231472_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line53_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231473_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line54_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231474_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line55_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231475_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line56_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231476_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">But for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line57_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231477_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">At length it ceased. The old man was dead.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line58_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231478_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line59_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231479_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">There was no pulsation.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line60_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231480_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more. If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line61_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231481_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. I took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line62_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231482_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line63_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231483_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no bloodspot whatever.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line64_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231484_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I had been too wary for that.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line65_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231485_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line66_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231486_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line67_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231487_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line68_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231488_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I smiled—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line69_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231489_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line70_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231490_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line71_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231491_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line72_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231492_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line73_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231493_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line74_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231494_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears; but still they sat, and still chatted.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line75_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231495_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">The ringing became more distinct;—it continued and became more distinct.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line76_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231496_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling, but it continued and gained definitiveness—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line77_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231497_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">No doubt I now grew very pale; but I talked more fluently and with a heightened voice.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line78_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231498_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line79_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231499_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line80_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231500_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line81_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231501_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased.</p>
</div><div class="panel">

<img src="img/line82_[dore_col_oil]_seed1731231502_output0.png" />
<p class="text top-left">Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased.</p>
